<h2>How to Choose the Best PEO for Restaurants</h2>
<h3>Understand your restaurant’s needs</h3>
<p>Not every restaurant has the same staffing patterns, schedules, or compliance worries. Consider your team size, number of locations, roles (hourly, tipped, salaried), and areas where you struggle—like scheduling or tip tracking. List your must-haves for a PEO: shift management, overtime compliance, benefits, or contractor onboarding?</p>

<h3>Check service offerings and restaurant-focused features</h3>
<p>Restaurant-friendly PEOs handle payroll for hourly workers, tips, and variable shifts. Confirm if they offer features like background checks, food service-specific benefits, and compliance with OSHA or wage laws. See if they integrate with POS or scheduling platforms you already use.</p>

<h3>Review compliance and risk management</h3>
<p>Restaurants face unique labor laws around overtime, wages, and tip pooling. Make sure your PEO has up-to-date knowledge in hospitality/hospitality law and provides direct compliance support during health department audits or wage disputes.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> If a PEO understands restaurant law and tip handling, you’ll avoid costly compliance mistakes.</p>

<h3>Test dashboard usability and integrations</h3>
<p>The best PEO for restaurants makes day-to-day admin simple for both owners and shift managers. Ask for a full product demo—pay attention to hiring, payroll, and reporting flows. Integrations with time clocks, POS, and inventory software can be a major plus for restaurant operators.</p>

<h3>Assess reputation and customer support</h3>
<p>Restaurants operate outside of 9-to-5 hours. Ask about support availability on weekends and nights. Look for reviews from other restaurants about how well the PEO handled urgent payroll, schedule changes, or compliance questions.</p>

<h3>Compare pricing and fee structures</h3>
<p>Request itemized quotes―not just per-employee pricing but also costs for seasonal staff, part-time hires, compliance audits, and benefit administration. Make sure there are no surprise fees for adding or removing staff between seasons.</p>

<h3>Consider scalability and exit process</h3>
<p>Restaurants can go from one location to many, or scale down after busy seasons. Choose a flexible PEO you can scale up or leave without penalty as your restaurant business evolves.</p>

<h2>PEO Pricing for Restaurants</h2>
<p>Restaurant payroll often changes month to month, so pricing structures matter. Most major PEOs bill per employee per month or as a percentage of payroll. Here’s what you can expect for the leading PEOs serving restaurants:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Provider</th><th>Pricing Model</th><th>Typical Cost</th><th>Setup Fees</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Multiplier</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$300–$400</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Remofirst</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$199–$349</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Remote</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$299–$599</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Justworks</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$59–$99</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paychex</td><td>Custom quote</td><td>$39–$200</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rippling</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$35–$80 (Core HR only)</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deel</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$49–$599</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Velocity global</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$300–$599</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Oyster</td><td>Per employee/month</td><td>$399–$699</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thera</td><td>Custom quote</td><td>Contact for pricing</td><td>Varies</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The biggest factors are your number of staff, mix of hourly and tipped employees, and extra HR needs like scheduling or recruiting. Setup fees are rare, but some legacy PEOs may charge them.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The best PEO for your restaurant is one that delivers real value—saving time, lowering compliance risk, and making tip/tax reporting easier.</p>

<h2>PEO Legal & Compliance for Restaurants</h2>
<p>Restaurants are held to high compliance standards—food safety, wage laws, and complex scheduling. A good restaurant PEO will act as a co-employer, taking on payroll, taxes, and benefits, so you can focus on running your business. In the U.S., make sure your PEO is IRS certified and has experience with hospitality clients.</p>
<p>Ask about their knowledge of FLSA, state tip pooling laws, youth employment, and local wage requirements. If operating internationally, look for a PEO with proven expertise in restaurant law for each target country.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Restaurant PEOs who offer compliance training and risk mitigation on harassment, scheduling, and health code issues will save you thousands in fines and potential lawsuits.</p>
